Picture Carousel clone of https://samuelbradley.com/portfolio/portfolio/ .

First you will need to install Node.js, git, and yarn. I did this through Homebrew, which I would reccomend.

In terminal launch it with 'yarn start'.
If you click to the left and right of the picture, you will cylce through the picture carousel.

How the code works:
- Put the 5 pictures in an array
- Made each button add or subtract the array index creating the slide effect
- display the current array index
- Navbar is just a normal and basic navbar

Future improvements:
- make a seperate css file for each component (so its not all clogged up in App.css and easier to access/read)
