First you will need to install Node.js, git, and yarn. I did this through Homebrew, which I would reccomend.

In terminal launch it with 'yarn start'.
If you click to the left and right of the picture, you will cylce through the picture carousel.

How the code works:
- Put the 5 pictures in an array
- Made each button add or subtract the array index creating the slide effect
- Navbar is just a normal and basic navbar

Future improvements:
- footer (super simple one that is regular)
- logo for the site
- text on the screen (maybe a header like "Picture Carousel")
- make a seperate css file for each component (so its not all clogged up in App.css and easier to access/read)
